                    <strong>The project focuses on optimal advertisement placement slots using the Knapsack problem.
                        Time is one of the greatest resources for television and radio stations. Broadcasting stations
                        must schedule programs interspersed with advertisements or commercials. It is important to
                        place adverts in such a way that the combination of adverts would have the largest exposure
                        possible so as to maximize the total return. The problem that we are trying to sort out can be
                        done by a single 0-1 knapsack problem that would yield optimal returns for television stations
                        as well as the entire media.
                        A dynamic programming algorithm will be used to solve this problem.
                        Methods for solving Knapsack Problem
                        The two basic methods for solving 0-1 knapsack problem are
                        Branch and Bound
                        and Dynamic programming methods
